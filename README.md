## Overview of Election Audit
Following a recent election, the Colorado Board of Elections requested an audit of the tabulated results from a US Congressional precinct in Colorado in the election. The task was assigned to Board of Election employees Tom and Seth. The objective was to determine the total number of votes cast, the total number of votes and percentages of votes for each candidate, as well as the winner of the election based on the popular vote. The total votes were collected from the mail-in-ballots that were counted by hand, the punch cards that were read by machine, and the memory cards from DRE counting machines that were sent to central office and counted by a machine at the office. Once all the votes were processed, data was extracted and analyzed to obtain the results of the election in that precinct. The audit was able to be automated by using Python instead of Excel. Because the automation process was successful, there is potential for the program that was written to be used for other congressional districts and even senatorial districts and local elections. 

## Election Audit Results
Through the automated auditing process using Python, the results of the election in the Colorado precinct can be viewed below. The image labeled "Final_Election_Analysis_Image" can be found in the Resources folder and the image can be used as reference. 

Election Results
-------------------------

Total Votes: 369,711

-------------------------

County Votes:

Jefferson: 10.5% (38, 855)

Denver: 82.8% (306, 055)

Arapahoe: 6.7% (24, 801)

---------------------------
Largest County Turnout: Denver

----------------------------

Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85, 213)

Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272, 892)

Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11, 606)

---------------------------
Winner: Diana DeGette

Winning Vote Count: 272, 892

Winning Percentage: 73.8%


----------------------------

The total number of votes cast in the precinct for the election was 369,711. In Jefferson county there were 38,855 ballots cast which represented 10.5% of the total vote count. In Denver county there were 306, 055 ballots cast which represented 82.8% of the total vote count. In Arapahoe county there were 24, 801 ballots cast which represented 6.7% of the total vote count. 

Based on the number of ballots cast in the election, it is clear that Denver county has the highest population and therefore had more influence on the election. Therefore the largest county turnout was Denver county. 

There were three candidates in the election. One of the candidates was Charles Casper who received 85,213 votes and that represented 23.0% of the total votes. The second candidate was Diana DeGette who received 272, 892 votes and that represented 73.8% of the total votes. The third candidate was Raymon Anthony Doane who received 11, 606 votes and that represented 3.1% of the total votes. 

The winner of the election in the precinct based on the popular vote was Diana Degette since she received 73.8% of the total vote in that precinct. 

## Election Audit Summary
The winner of the election was clearly Diana DeGette since she received almost 75% percent of the total votes in that Colorado precinct. 

Further analysis that can be done is using the data to determine how many votes and the percentage of votes that each candidate received in each of the three counties in that precinct. Another useful application of the code would be to determine how many ballots were cast compared to how many people lived in each of those counties. 

The code that was used to audit and analyze the election data from the Colorado precinct is very useful because it can have applications in other situations. It can be used for other congressional districts and even senatorial districts and local elections. As long as there is election data that is available then the code can be used to analyze that data and determine the results. Also because the code was written on Python, it can easily be accessed and reviewed to make sure there is no fraudulent activity when the results were calculated since some people these days are so caught up in conspiracy theories.
